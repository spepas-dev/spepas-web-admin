I am thinking of a number of senarios;

- there are two endpoints for getting GOPA requests. 
there is the assigned active request and the unassigned active request. 
when the request button is clicked, I want the user to be routed to requests page 
and on that page they should see or be able to navigate to assigned active request and assigned request history, 
vice versa for when the user clicked history, the see assigned request history and unassigned request history
